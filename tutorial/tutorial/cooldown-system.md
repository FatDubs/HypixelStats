# \[Cooldown System\]

#### When you send a request, you will receive cooldown points. If you have 6 or more cooldown points, then the bot will ignore you. You lose one cooldown point every 6 seconds. You receive cooldown points by doing the following:

* party - 5 cd
* friend - 2 cd
* warp - 60 cd
* msg - 1 cd

#### keep in mind that warping doesn't do anything, you just get blacklisted for 6 minutes.
