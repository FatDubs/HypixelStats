# HypixelStats
Hypixel Stats is a project that allows hypixel players to more easily use the hypixel api to view players' stats in-game.
It works by messaging a bot the username(s) of (a) player(s) or inviting the bot to a party and it will reply with the stats of the gamemode defined.

Please note that this project is heavily under development so there isn't even a beta yet.
