# HypixelStats

Hypixel Stats is a project that allows players to more easily use the hypixel api to view players' stats in-game without having to visit a website, use a blacklisted mod, or an external program. It works by messaging a bot the username\(s\) of \(a\) player\(s\) or inviting the bot to a party and it will reply with the stats of the gamemode defined.

## IMPORTANT
The project is somewhat finished, however, it's not ready to release because I still need to code a different main.py file for people who would self host, and if I released it now as it is, everyone could just change the code and I would not get recognized for creating it, so I need to wait until there is a decent amount of people in my discord, I can change my alt's username from bwstatsv2, and when I finish the open source version.
